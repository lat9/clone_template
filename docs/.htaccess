# This is used with Apache WebServers

# The following blocks direct HTTP requests to all filetypes in this directory recursively, except certain approved exceptions
# It also prevents the ability of any scripts to run. No type of script, be it PHP, PERL or whatever, can normally be executed if ExecCGI is disabled.
# Will also prevent people from seeing what is in the dir. and any sub-directories
#
# For this to work, you must include either 'All' or at least: 'Limit' and 'Indexes' parameters to the AllowOverride configuration in your apache/conf/httpd.conf file.
# Example:
#<Directory "/usr/local/apache/htdocs">
#  AllowOverride Limit Indexes
#</Directory>

# deny *everything*
<FilesMatch ".*\..*">
Order Allow,Deny
Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

# but now allow just *certain* necessary files:
<FilesMatch "(?i).*\.(js|css|jpg|gif|png|html|pdf)$">
Order Allow,Deny
Allow from all
</FilesMatch>
